x = int(input("What is x? "))
y = int(input("What is y? "))

### Using if, elif, else
#if x < y:
#    print("x is less than y")

#elif x > y:
#    print("x is greater than y")

#else :
#    print("x is equal to y")

### Using or nd not equal

#if x < y or x > y:
#    print("x is not equal to y")
#else:
#    print("x is equal to y")

if x != y:
    print("x is not equal to y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
