### Make 3 meows

i = 3 # defined a variable that indicates the amount of times we want the action to take place
while i != 0: # a condition that the program must meet in order to execute the action, otherwise stopping.
    print("meow") # the action we want to take
    i = i - 1 # a change or update to the variable that happens in every loop to prevent from infinite looping.
